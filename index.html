    <p>Welcome, I am Levi Glendenning I have been interested in web development for a few years. Starting 3 years ago I heard about Data Science and stated looking into it.Since then I have done a some workshops in Python and SQL along with some online courses too. Over time I thought it would be better for to start a little smaller and look into careers as a Web Developer and bootcamps in Web development. So in October of 2017 I signed up for the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp and boom, here I am working on my frist homework woundering why I decited to do this?</p>
    <p>My pass working experance has been in logistics and Transportation with the most recent working for Pepsi as a Senior Logistics Analyst for the last 5 years. Before that I worked for FedEx, Watkins Shepard Trucking Co and Catapillar. I have a bachlors degree in Business Administaion with a emphasis in Management and Marketing that I earned in 2005.</p>
