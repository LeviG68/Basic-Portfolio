# Basic-Portfolio

Professional portfolio from the beginning, this is my frist project that I built on when I started my Full Stack program.

## Languages 
 HTML and CSS and just starting to understand how to use Git!.
 
This was my first project that I did starting my web development career. I used HTML and CSS to build this basic form trying to understand what CSS is and what it does. Hopefully I can look back this and ask myself what were you doing and what I would do different if I had to build it again.

## Motivation
This was our 1st class assigment to do, learning how to use HTML tags and working with CSS positing, containers and styling.

## Tech
HTML
CSS
