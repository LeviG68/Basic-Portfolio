 HTML, CSS and just starting to understand how to use Git!.
 
This was my first project that I did starting my web development career. I used HTML and CSS to build this basic form trying to understand what CSS is and what it does. Hopefully I can look back this and ask myself what were you doing and what I would do different if I had to build it again.
